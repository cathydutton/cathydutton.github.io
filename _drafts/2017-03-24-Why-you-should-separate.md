PostCSS Maze as demo


Why you should separate layout and content,

1)	width structure etc should not effect the modules which can grow to fit any container they may be in.

2)	Loads of images to support this

3)	Post css maze with one layout sheet as example.

4)	Completely separate wireframe or structure partial
