A well thought out service should flow naturally in the same way that a conversation would. Each new question put to the user should relate to the information they have already provided and progress in logical steps.

The user journey should also flow from topic to topic, not jump sporadically from service choices to user information. In most cases a service can be split into two topics...

1)	The service  - Options relating to the service the user requires such as type or length of licence, start date and times etc.

2)  The user - Information about the user required either by the organisation or to identify available products. Date of birth, address, name, concession screens etc.

So which should come first?


## Service first

In user centered design the user, and their needs should always come first, therefore the service
should focus on the users goal. Any further questions which represent a organisational need, such as the users personal information should come second.

// IMAGE OF BASIC FLOW!!!! - service -- user

benefits of putting the service questions first...

- User focused - Address the user needs before that of the organisation.
- Quick and easy for experienced/return users
- Allows only the required user questions to be asked - If we need more information for certain - products.

However there are some drawbacks to this approach for example...

- Doesn't provide guidance for new users
- Users may not be making informed decisions
- Can result in users being presented with options that do not apply to them (Junior specific answers!)
- Price points may be defined by the users details


### price

Price can be a key factor in a users decision making process. If price is determined by the user then it can be...



## User first
Sometimes the services or products available are determined by the user. We may also need to collect a user's details to enable us to deliver the best possible service for them and to help guide them to the best product for their needs.

benefits of putting the service questions first...

- Can add price points more easily if there are disabled or age related discounts
- Show only the relevant screens if some screens are added for only certain products)
- Ask anticipated questions before surprising ones - IE start with name!
- Don't make users think - Show the recommended licence type and costs based on their personal information.

#### negative points
- It could be unclear why all questions are being asked
- Cant ask concession questions until we know the licence length

This site wants to know so much about me, but I know nothing about it.‚Äù



### How to determine the right way for your service

Create flow charts with post-it notes or cards, highlight key points in the journey where most logic is built around.

Highlight cards that appear in all journeys

Add sticky notes for key pages where price points could be added

Add sticky notes for key pages where users have struggled



### Goal first

The reason the user has come to the site. Users have visited the service for a reason, one we determine that reason we can create a tailored flow asking only the required questions.











### In summary

There is no one size fit's al solution, each service will have a different set of criteria to work with
