What comes first the user or the service?

For digital services the user, and the user’s needs should always come first. Any further questions which represent a business need, such as a users personal information should come second.
However, sometimes we first need to collect some information from the user to enable us to deliver the best possible service. So what should come first in the user flow?

Users first
Therefore services should begin by determining what it is that the user is trying to achieve. 
Can add price points more easily if there are disabled or age releated discounts.
	.	Put my needs first. Address my needs before demanding I address yours.


Service first
Ecomerce sites as examples

Goal first


There is no right answer, nothing will ever be perfect for everybody.

	•	The main tasks they want to achieve
