Both - back in the web designer days - design and dev
Carosel story - style over function
Dev - Sass, Grunt, Gulp, Git - problem solving, best practices
Modular code - not helped by page design

Being passed full page ui designs and having to fudge in accesabiity concerns.

UX - form follows function - old product design phrase
Accesability baked in
Button journey
form journey
desicion making

Working for a design consultancy I was asked with designing a home page for a small skip hire company. After discussions with the business owner we determined that they hd one major selling point over there rivals. They were cheap. I created a layout with a banner section at the top body displaying the message “We will beat any quote” The banner was not part of a slider and there was no transition between that and any other message.

The customer was very happy with this, however the design did not pass the customary senior designer review. The feedback I received was that the company had design guidelines with 3 or 4 slides used teach promoting a differentant USP. This went pagans the customers wishes and diluted his primary selling point.

I remember once being told I must include a jQuery slider on a small static website for a local skip hire company, regardless of wether or not there was a need for this, or even any content to use in the slider.

It was around 2012 and the design consultancy I worked for had a fairly strict design guide with a one hat fits all approach to customer websites. I faced a similar issue much more recently when asked to come up with a design for a new company website. I was shown a selection of sites that the stakeholders liked and wanted to use, I was instructed to design this site and have the content ‘added’ later.

Both of these situations made me fall out of love with design
