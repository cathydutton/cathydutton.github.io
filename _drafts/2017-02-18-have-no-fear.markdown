Designing new products or services can be a daunting or even intimidating process at times. How do you create an experience that works well for everybody? How do you design for edge cases you don't yet know exist? What if people don't like, or worse cant use the service? 

There are many fears a designer will need to overcome in order to create successful user experiences including...

- <b>A fear of failure</b> - ????

- <b>A fear of negative feedback</b> - It can be difficult to get past the fear of a negative response, or to not take the feedback as a direct or personal criticism.

- <b>A fear of imperfection</b> - It's tempting to keep your designs close, showing nothing until your completely satisfied with your work.

To create successful user focused designs it is essential to move past these fears, and to except and embrace all forms of feedback as soon as possible.

## Expect to fail

Failure is not a bad thing, and in design it should be expected. Every design will fail for some people, some of the time. Its important to remember that these failures are not permanent, just steps on the path towards a more inclusive solution. 

Expecting these failures can remove the fear factor and allow for more creativity in the design process. If nothing you create ever fails could you really say that you have pushed yourself to think beyond what is currently available?

During the Alpha phase of a project there is no shame in admitting a prototype or theory just didn't work out. This approach should be actively encouraged to ensure we get the most out of this phase. Try the previously untried, it's the only way to improve upon existing solutions.

## Embrace user feedback

Put your design and content choices to the test of real life. In order to get the user feedback we crave, we need to show real users something. This something will almost certainly have its problems, but it gives us a starting point which can be used to get us closer to a useable product.

Bad or negative user feedback is a good thing, we can learn much more from this then from success stories. Each edge case we discover will help us to create a better more inclusive design.


### Let go of perfection

You don’t know what your users want and most of the time neither do they, you will never achieve perfection for every user in every situation and in all circumstances, but you can get closer through a series of failed attempts. 

Sometimes the best way to work out what users want is to show them something they don't. You have to start somewhere, with something in order to get the feedback you need to make designs work.

We have already accepted that no design can ever be perfect for every user in every situation, so why strive for it? Instead the focus should be to get a usable product out into the world. Through real user feedback we can then improve on this piece by piece getting closer to perfection with each iteration.

Holding on to designs for to long can leave us stuck heading blindly down the wrong path, as tempting as it is to show only ur best, completed work it is important to get real user feedback as soon as possible. You can test anything from paper prototypes to rough wireframes and post it note flow charts. Getting these things out in the open will help ensure our more polished efforts are usable.

Design sprints can help to get you into this working pattern, plan a testing session for the end of the sprint and work to that deadline. Do not only think about testing when you think the deign is ready (you will never be ready).

There is no point wasting time perfecting a concept if nobody has used it yet
