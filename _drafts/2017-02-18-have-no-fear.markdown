Every design fails
Free of fear
Proper Alpha
Failure is not a bad thing, or a negative word. It’s also not really even thing. If you go back and fix the thing that was broken then it was actually never really broken just unfinished. Unless you were measuring success at that exact point in time.
If the product or service you are working on is an on going process, one that can be iterated on and that evolve and grows then to label it or measure it at any given point in time would be senseless.

In essence until the process is completely finished and or wrapped up, all the designers and developers have moved on to live the service to stand on its own two feet. it can never be seen to have failed.

As a user focused designer, failure should be expected. Neither you or your users know exactly how something should work, but you can work it out through  series of failed attempts.
You can not start by asking how something should behave, look, or function. Users don’t know what it is they need until you show them something that is wrong.

“Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently” Henry ford
“If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.” Henry ford

In order to get the user feedback we crave, we first need to show them something. This thing will almost certainly not be the final thing, but it is a starting point which can be used to get us there.
Because of this every design is destined to  fail at some point. Its how we learn, from these failings that count. By embracing this early on we can free ourselves from the fear of failure, and begin to experiment with me adventures and createve solutions
Bad user feedback is a good thing.
You can’t just ask what some one wants, you have to show something, and listen to the feedback to determine what would work.

If you want to succeed, you should except to fail



We learn more from failure then success

Alpha phase - try the untried but do not be afraid to start again.
Some one once told me the bravest thing a person can do is admit they have made a mistake and start again from the beginning. The advice was regarding a college fine art project, but can be applied more and more to front end development.
There is no shame in creating a clean slate, it is not an admission of failure, instead it shows an understanding of the industry we work in. It shows a desire to move forward utilising new technologies and ways of working.
