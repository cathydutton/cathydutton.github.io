Nobody enjoys having their work reviewed, or opening themselves up to be judged on a project they have spent months trying to perfect. It's difficult to get past the fear of a negative response, or to not take the feedback as a direct or personal criticism.

It's also tempting to keep your designs close, showing nothing until your completely satisfied with it. To create successful user focused designs it is essential to move past these fears, and to except and embrace all forms of feedback as soon as possible.

In the world of continuous improvement it’s also not really a thing that can happen. If you go back and fix the thing that failed then it was never really broken, just unfinished. -->

## Expect to fail

Every design fails, if not for all users then for some and if not now then it certainly did at some point in the the past. Failure is not a bad thing, and in design should be expected.

You don’t know what your users want and most of the time neither do they, you will never achieve perfection for every user in every situation and all circumstances, but you can get closer and closer through a series of failed attempts.

By accepting accepting that designs concepts will fail early in the design process you can free yourself from the fear of failure, and begin to experiment with more adventures and creative solutions. It’s ok if these ideas fail the important thing is to get real user feedback early on so you can make changes.

<!-- This allows designers not to be constrained by how things are currently done, and to search for much better solutions to common problems. -->



<!-- Some one once told me the bravest thing a person can do is admit they have made a mistake and start again from the beginning. The advice was regarding a college fine art project, but can be applied to the design process as well.

There is no shame in creating a clean slate, it is not an admission of failure, instead it shows an understanding of the industry we work in. It shows a desire to move forward Utilising new information and knowledge. -->

## Bad user feedback is a good thing

In order to get the user feedback we crave, we first need to show them something. This thing will almost certainly fail, but it gives us a starting point which can be used to get us closer to a useable product.

We learn more from failure then success???

You can not start with user research, users don’t know what it is they need until you show them something that is wrong.



### Let go of perfection
We have already accepted that no design can ever be perfect for every user in every situation, this free us to focus on making small and regular improvements, getting more valuable user feedback at every stage.

There is no point wasting time perfecting a concept if nobody has used it yet
