Designing new products or services can be a daunting or even intimidating process at times. How do you create an experience that works well for everybody? How do you design for edge or stress cases you don't yet know exist? What if people don't like, or worse cant use the service?

There are many fears a designer will need to overcome in order to create successful user experiences including...

- <b>The fear of failure</b> - ????

- <b>The fear of negative feedback</b> - It can be difficult to get past the fear of a negative response, or to not take the feedback as a direct or personal criticism.

- <b>The fear of imperfection</b> - It's tempting to keep your designs close, showing nothing until your completely satisfied with your work.

To create successful user focused designs it is essential to move past these fears, to except failures and to embrace all forms of feedback as soon as possible in the design process.

## Expect to fail

If nothing you create ever fails can you really claim to have pushed yourself creatively? Or to have to experimented with concepts and theories that go beyond what is currently available?

Failure is not a bad thing, and in design it should be expected. Every design will fail for some users, some of the time. Its important to remember that these failures are not permanent, just steps on the path towards a more inclusive solution.

Accepting these failures can remove the fear factor and allow for a more creative design process where boundaries are pushed. During the Alpha phase of a project there is no shame in admitting that a prototype or user journey just didn't work. This approach should be encouraged to ensure the team gets the most out of this phase. Trying the previously untried is the only way to improve existing services.

## Embrace user feedback

Put your design and content choices to the test in real life with real users. In order to get the user feedback we need, we first need to show something. This something will almost certainly have its flaws, but it gives us a starting point which can be used to get closer to a useable service.

Bad or negative user feedback is a good thing, providing it is used constructively to improve the service. Nobody can be expected to design an experience that works seamlessly in all situations but the more feedback we receive the closer we can get to this. Each stress case we discover will help us to create a better more inclusive design.

### Let go of perfection

Design is never perfect, no matter how much we want it to be, there is little point wasting time trying to perfect a concept that is yet to be seen by any real users.

<!-- We can't be expected to know what our users will want or even who our users could be -->

We will never achieve perfection for every use case in all situation and circumstances, but we can get closer to perfection through a series of failed attempts.





Sometimes the best way to work out what users want is to show them something they don't. You have to start somewhere, with something in order to get the feedback you need to make designs work.

We have already accepted that no design can ever be perfect for every user in every situation, so why strive for it? Instead the focus should be to get a usable product out into the world. Through real user feedback we can then improve on this piece by piece getting closer to perfection with each iteration.

Holding on to designs for to long can leave us stuck heading blindly down the wrong path, as tempting as it is to show only ur best, completed work it is important to get real user feedback as soon as possible. You can test anything from paper prototypes to rough wireframes and post it note flow charts. Getting these things out in the open will help ensure our more polished efforts are usable.

Design sprints can help to get you into this working pattern, plan a testing session for the end of the sprint and work to that deadline. Do not only think about testing when you think the deign is ready (you will never be ready).
