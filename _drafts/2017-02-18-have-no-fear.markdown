#Have no fear
Every design fails, if not for all users then for some and if not now then it certainly did at some point in the the past. Failure is not a bad thing, or a negative word. 
In the world of continuous improvement it’s also not really a thing that can happen. If you go back and fix the thing that failed then it was never really broken, just unfinished.
##Success follows failure
In design failure should be expected. You don’t know what your users want and neither do they, but you can work it out through series of failed attempts. Its how we learn, from these failings that count, by embracing this early on we can free ourselves from the fear of failure, and begin to experiment with more adventures and creative solutions during the early stages of a project.
This allows designers not to be constrained by how things are currently done, and to search for much better solutions to common problems. 

it’s ok if these ideas fail, some one once told me the bravest thing a person can do is admit they have made a mistake and start again from the beginning. The advice was regarding a college fine art project, but can be applied to the design process as well.
There is no shame in creating a clean slate, it is not an admission of failure, instead it shows an understanding of the industry we work in. It shows a desire to move forward utilising new information and knowledge.


##Bad user feedback is a good thing 
In order to get the user feedback we crave, we first need to show them something. This thing will almost certainly fail, but it is the starting point which can be used to get us closer to a useable service.
“The only thing that makes your designs better is understanding your users, measuring things in the real world, and knowing that you will launch things — often — that don’t “work”. - Joel Marsh: Experience Architect


You can not start with user research, users don’t know what it is they need until you show them something that is wrong.



###Let go of perfection
No design will ever be perfect for every user in every situation , ( 3 disability model things)

“If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.” Henry ford

We learn more from failure then success
