Three fears every designer will need to overcome...

- The fear of failure - every design fails for some people some of the time - its not permanent- having no fear allows for more creativity.
- The fear of negative feedback - its a good thing - we learn more etc
- The fear of imperfection - It holds us back from the feedback we need

Nobody enjoys having their work reviewed, it's difficult to get past the fear of a negative response, or to not take the feedback as a direct or personal criticism.

It's also tempting to keep your designs close, showing nothing until your completely satisfied with your work.

To create successful user focused designs it is essential to move past these fears, and to except and embrace all forms of feedback as soon as possible.

## Expect to fail

Every design fails, if not for all users then for some and if not now then it certainly did at some point in the the past.

Failure is not a bad thing, and in design it should be expected. If nothing you create ever fails then have you really pushed yourself to think beyond what is currently available?

You don’t know what your users want and most of the time neither do they, you will never achieve perfection for every user in every situation and all circumstances, but you can get closer through a series of failed attempts. These failures are not permanent, if we use a continuous improvement model, nothing ever is.

By accepting accepting failures as part of the design process you can free yourself from fear, and begin to experiment with more adventures and creative solutions.

<!-- This allows designers not to be constrained by how things are currently done, and to search for much better solutions to common problems. -->

<!-- Some one once told me the bravest thing a person can do is admit they have made a mistake and start again from the beginning. The advice was regarding a college fine art project, but can be applied to the design process as well.

There is no shame in creating a clean slate, it is not an admission of failure, instead it shows an understanding of the industry we work in. It shows a desire to move forward Utilising new information and knowledge. -->

<!--
In the world of continuous improvement it’s also not really a thing that can happen. If you go back and fix the thing that failed then it was never really broken, just unfinished. -->

## Embrace user feedback

In order to get the user feedback we crave, we first need to show them something. This thing will almost certainly fail, but it gives us a starting point which can be used to get us closer to a useable product.

Bad or negative user feedback is a good thing, we can learn much more from this then from success stories. Each edge case we discover will help us to create a better more inclusive design solution.

Feedback should be gathered regularly, with amendments made after each session.

Alpha phase vs continuous improvement phase


### Let go of perfection

Sometimes the best way to work out what users want is to show them something they don't. You have to start somewhere, with something in order to get the feedback you need to make designs work.

We have already accepted that no design can ever be perfect for every user in every situation, so why strive for it? Instead the focus should be to get a usable product out into the wild. Through real user feedback we can then improve on this piece by piece getting closer to perfection with each release.

this free us to focus on making small and regular improvements, getting more valuable user feedback at every stage.

Holding on to designs for to long can leave us stuck heading blindly down the wrong path, as tempting as it is to show only ur best, completed work it is important to get real user feedback as soon as possible. You can test anything from paper prototypes to rough wireframes and post it note flow charts. Getting these things out in the open will help ensure our more polished efforts are usable.

Design sprints can help to get you into this working pattern, plan a testing session for the end of the sprint and work to that deadline. Do not only think about testing when you think the deign is ready (you will never be ready).

There is no point wasting time perfecting a concept if nobody has used it yet
