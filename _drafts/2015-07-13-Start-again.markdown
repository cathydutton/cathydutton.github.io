“pretty design but bad code”

Some one once told me the bravest thing a person can do is admit they have made a mistake and start again from the beginning. The advice was regarding a college fine art project, but can be applied more and more to front end development.

A poorly thought through codebase, wether he result of poor planning, a change in business direction or out dated technologies will always create problems. These problems can range from poor loading times or specificity issues to ……

These foundations will only get worse the more they are built on top of, regardless of how good the ‘new code’ is. 

Shaky foundations will only get worse the more they get added to, eventually you end up trying to put icing on a burnt cake.

Cars don’t continually add improvements to the original engine, they at some point scrap everything and start again. 

There is no shame in creating a clean slate, it is not an admission of failure, instead it shows an understanding of the industry we work in. It shows a desire to move forward utilising  new technologies and ways of working.

Of course I don’t mean we should ‘start again’ on a whim every 6 months or so. A proper code base should always plan for the future and code from an open minded point of view, but there does come a time when starting again is the only option.

That time is when you find yourself working on a platform with 2 different grid implementations, 3 naming conventions at least 3 half hearted attempts at using a CSS methodology, 30 plus jQuery plugins, JSP’s, String templates and Handlebars templates.

You can not not fix your shakey foundations by sweeping the floors or cleaning the windows, nor is there any point in icing an already burnt cake.

Only once you have your house in order should extra ‘nice to have’ techniques like gzipping, critical css loading etc be implemented.




EXAMPLE

Serving critical CSS first 




Serving up critical CSS can help with load times, however your code first needs to be in a place where the critical CSS has been separated from the experience enhancing CSS.
