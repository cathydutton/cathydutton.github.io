I recently started a new job which I love, traditional design tools such as Photoshop, Illustrator and Sketch are no longer a part of my working day wich makes me very happy. Gone also are the ongoing debates around which prototyping tools we should be using and how best to share what we build with the rest of the team.

Sketching

Build with code

1 prototype fpr all screens

speed of changes and tweaks

open url to share aroud

Ability to produce usable soloutions and test code for accesability and performance - cant do this in prototypes

Keeps me working with CSS :) and semantic markup

Greater control over the final output

Problems - Can be time consuming - but only build after testing sketches

Takes investment upfront to build a design language in code, longrt term bennefitd make this woth while
