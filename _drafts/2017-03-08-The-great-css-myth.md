CSS is often seen as the simplest of the front end technologies, if ever CSS goes wrong on a project or becomes a problem it is the fault of the language itself as apposed to the fault of the people who wrote it. How can something so simple have been written wrongly?



## CSS is not broken
CSS is not broken despite numerous tweets and articles to the contrary



## CSS is not broken

CSS is not broken, it works exactly as intended, you just need to utilise it properly.....


### CSS is easy

### Css is not scalable
Think outside the pixel, plan for change, dont add heights etc

CSS is scalable when used correctly,

### It's just for making things pretty

Visualy hidden styles aid accesability and skip links, active and visited classes also.

You hear a lot of grunblings about CSS cascade and it's aparent negative inpacct on styesheets.  the glbal scope can be incerdibaly advantageous - new markup instantly looks and feels right, buttons links and headings are consistent. etc

"You should want “global” styles: colors and spacing should be consistent throughout your application. Similar components need to look similar. Your buttons should all be consistently sized and your box shadows or border radiuses should not be ad-hoc."

### You need a framework

### New features should always be used

### Frameworks are bad

### It cant be optimised for speed
