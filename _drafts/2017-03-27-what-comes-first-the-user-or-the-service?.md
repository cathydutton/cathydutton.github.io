A well thought out service should flow naturally in the same way that a conversation would. Each new question put to the user should relate to the information they have already provided and progress in logical steps.

The user journey should also flow from topic to topic, not jump sporadically from service choices to requests for user information. In most cases a service can be split into two topics...

1)	The service  - Options relating to the service the user requires for example type or length of licence.

2)  The user - Information about the user required either by the organisation or to identify available products, for example Date of birth, or address.

So which should come first the user or the service?


## Service first

In user centered design the user, and their needs should always come first, therefore the service should aim to focus on the users end goal. Any additional questions should come at the end of the journey.

There are many benefits to this approach including...

- Addressing the needs of the user before that of your own
- Opening the service with expected questions, making it quick and easy for experienced or return users to complete
- Creating a simplified journey by asking only the questions required for the selected product

However there are some drawbacks for example, by opening the service with product related questions we loose the opportunity to provide guidance for new or inexperienced users. As a result of this users may be making ill-informed decisions. Users could also be presented with questions that do not apply to them.

## User first
Sometimes the services or products available are determined by the user. In these situations we need to collect the user's details first to enable us to create

deliver the best possible service for them or to help guide them to the best product for their needs.

benefits of first determining who the user is...

- Can add price points more easily if there are disabled or age related discounts
- Show only the relevant screens if some screens are added for only certain products
- Ask anticipated questions before surprising ones - IE start with name!
- Don't make users think - Show the recommended licence type and costs based on their personal information.

#### negative points
- It could be unclear why all questions are being asked
- Cant ask concession questions until we know the licence length

### So which should come first?

Each service will have it's own unique criteria with pros and cons for each aproach. When designing the 'get a fishing licence' we experimented with both theroes??? each and most importantly tested both with real users.

### How to determine the right way for your service??????
Firstly write each screen on to a card or post it note.

Identify the key decision screens - in our case theese were Licence length, Date of birth and the third one.

Also create cards for each journy and add markers to highlight which screnns are inluded in which journeys.

Arange them into orders and then use color coded notes to highlight positive and negative aspects.

Do this for numerous journy flows.

Dob

- Exit juniors and under 12's much quicker
- Can show accurate prices once we reach the service questions
- Concesion sceens will be outof flow with users details.



Licence length

- Concesion sceens will in the right place
- No price can be shown
- Juniors will be shown short term options that are not the best option for them




Third ones
- Can move concession screens to a more logical place if we know the product type.
- Juniors exit quickly
- Can show pricing information
- Keeps the flow consistent for all future senrios and products



Create flow charts with post-it notes or cards, highlight key points in the journey where most logic is built around.

Highlight cards that appear in all journeys

Add sticky notes for key pages where price points could be added

Add sticky notes for key pages where users have struggled

- Price points may be defined by the users details

### price

Price can be a key factor in a users decision making process. If the price can be effected by  user details, for example senior or junior discounts then the user must be identifyed to allow for accurate pricicng.

## Consistancy

The flow should remain the same for all poriducts to aid return journeys, renew, uograde, change details etc.

### Goal first

The reason the user has come to the site. Users have visited the service for a reason, one we determine that reason we can create a tailored flow asking only the required questions.

### In summary

There is no one size fit's al solution, each service will have a different set of criteria to work with it is important to experiment with diferent flows to ensure you get the best results for your service.

We are continuing to test the service with new and experienced Anglers with a view to launching new features like upgrades and price points in he near future.
