Form should follow function, i.e an object or digital thing should work seemlesly before attention is paid for nthe asthetics.

Designing for hapines leans more towards asthetics, to form emotional atachements.

People do not notice things that just work, which is a good thing but includesd no emotion.

"At a basic level, this means the aesthetics are important. Universal principles of beauty, like the Golden Ratio, the Rule of Thirds, and principles of proximity, alignment, contrast, and repetition inform our innate sense of whether something is beautiful or not. Universal design elements, like saturated hues, harmonious sounds, smiling faces, symmetrical objects, rounded shapes, attractive people also contribute to positive affect. As we move from the design of mostly visual experiences to more sensory experience, this might also mean warmth, sweet tastes, or a soft touch.Â "
