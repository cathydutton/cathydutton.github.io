“CFO asks his CEO, “What happens if we invest in developing our people and then they leave the company?” CEO answers, ‘What happens if we don’t, and they stay?”

“If your the smartest person in the room, your in the wrong room”

I've been working as a Front End Developer for almost 10 years now, and have held 8 full time positions. I've always felt completely justified in my decisions to leave jobs and start again elsewhere. It seems to be a trend within the industry with most companies I've worked for having frequent departures and seemingly endless recruitment drives.

Conferences
Show and tells
Bring in speakers
Bring in contract developers on short term contracts
Crowdsourcing
Varied projects - Maintaining - New builds, future technologies
Hack days - a break from background
Blue sky projects
Training
Trust - Hours to be worked, from home, evenings etc




How do you keep hold of the best developers?
