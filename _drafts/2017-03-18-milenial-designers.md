I've been working as a Designer and front end developer for over 12 years now, and have held 8 full time positions. I've always felt completely justified in my decisions to leave jobs and start again elsewhere. It seems to be a trend within the industry with most companies I've worked for having frequent departures and seemingly endless recruitment drives.

But why is this?

I've often heard it put down to "Milenials" and a lack of loyalty/comitment .....

"Almost 50% of millennials around the world say they plan to leave their job within 2 years, according to a new Deloitte survey. And big salaries alone won't keep them from going."
