CSS gets a lot of abuse, the internet is full of articles describing ways to fix one, or all of it's so called failings. However most of the time these criticisms are unfair, untrue or both. This post aims to highlight some of the common misconceptions or myths around CSS and it's capabilities.

### 1) CSS is broken

So first of all CSS is not broken, it just isn't a programing language and so should not be expected to behave like one. Many of the CSS in JavaScript methodologies that have appeared over the past couple of years aim to 'fix' CSS by forcing it to behave in a more conventional programming way, in doing so some fundamental CSS features are overwritten.

You can read more on the topic of broken CSS in these two awesome articles...

### 2) CSS is easy
CSS is not easy, it may been seen as the simplest of the front end languages, but creating a maintainable CSS code base at scale is a difficult skill to master. Like no other front end language any changes made in CSS have the potential to affect the global landscape, meaning extra discipline and knowledge are required.

To work effectively a detailed understanding of key CSS features is essential.


#### 1) Cascade
The cascade determines which properties will be applied, and can be thought of as a way of resolving conflicting styles.

Which selector wins out in the cascade depends on three factors:

* Importance
* Specificity
* Source order

On larger projects a misunderstanding of the cascade can lead to excessive and improper use of the !important rule as well as out of control CSS.

#### Importance
There are three origins of styles, each one has a level of importance used by the cascade to determine which properties will be applied.

* 1) Author
* 2) User 
* 3) Default (User agent or browser stylesheet)

This order can be reversed by using the !important rule allowing a property in the user style sheet to override a matching declaration in the author stylesheet.

 
#### Specificity 
Specificity comes into play if the importance of two declarations is the same. A 4 digit number is given to each selector, this number is derived from...

* Inline styles (Style attribute)
* The number of ID's in the selector
* The number of classes, attributes and pseudo-classes in the selector
* The number of elements and pseudo-elements in the selector

##### For example 

```
#nav .selected > a:hover {
  
}
```
Has the value 0,1,2,1. The selector with the higher specificity will be applied.

  Specifics on CSS specificity: [Specifics on CSS specificity - CSS tricks territories](https://css-tricks.com/specifics-on-css-specificity/ "Specifics on CSS specificity - CSS tricks") is a great article to get up to speed on specificity. 


[Hacks for dealing with specificity - csswizardry.com](https://csswizardry.com/2014/07/hacks-for-dealing-with-specificity/ "Hacks for dealing with specificity - csswizardry.com") also has some great tips for working with specificity on large projects.

The !important rule is not directly related to specificity as it does not have a value assigned to it. It does however automatically win out against any other selectors. The only way to override and !important deceleration is to use another !important decleration on a selector of equal or higher specificity.
  

#### Source order 
Source order comes into play if the importance and specificity of two declarations is the same.

Declarations that appear at the bottom of a stylesheet will effectively overwrite any matching declarations from above.


#### 2) Inheritance
CSS properties like font-family and color can be applied to a single element and be passed down to the elements children.

Inheritance can be controlled using three CSS properties:

* inherit
* initial
* unset

 A directly targeted element will always take precedence over rules which an element inherits from its ancestor.


###  3) Global scope is a bad thing
CSS is often compared unfavourably to the localised scoping features of JavaScript. It is true that, when mis-understood the global nature of CSS can lead to a tangled web of CSS littered with !important declarations and excessively long selectors (both of which introduce a new set of problems).

However the global by default feature of CSS is actually a great asset, if you know how to use it. The cascade and inheritance together determine how all elements will be styled, this allows you to create base level rules just once and have them applied across a projects code base. 

Benefits of the CSS global scope include:
 
 * New markup looks right without the need to add any new CSS
 * Typography and spacing are consistent
 * Design patterns are consistent
 * Project CSS is re-usable
 * Project CSS remains scalable and easy to update consistently


###  4) There is no local scope

CSS where required can be scoped, the simplest method for this would be by using double classes and a naming convention such as BEM: [BEM - methodology ](http://getbem.com/ "BEM - methodology") to target specific chunks of UI without effecting the entire application.

```
// Default button
.button {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 15px;	
  border: 0;  
	text-align: center;
  background-color: #00823b;
  color: #fff;
}

// Success button
.button--success { 
  background-color: #005ea5;
}

// cancel button
.button--cancel	{ 
  background-color: $primary-color--featured; 
}

```
```
<div class='button'>Default button</div>
<div class='button button--success'>Success button</div>
<div class='button button--cancel'>Cancel button</div>
```

You can also add scope to your CSS using custom properties. Custom properties, also known as CSS variables allow values to be saved and re-used throughout a project. In that respect they are similar to Sass or less variables, but have the added bonus of being dynamic.

Custom properties are defined like this...

```
:root {
  --button-color: #ffa600;
}
```
and used like this...

```
.button {
  background-color: var(--button-color);
}
```
Custom properties can be scoped by declaring values inside a class or element. In the below example the value assigned to the buttons background color is changed for all elements within a header block.

```
// Global variable
:root {
  --primary-color: #ffa600;
}

// Header specific variable
header {
  --button-color: #aaa19a;
}

.button {
  background-color: var(--button-color);
}
```

### 5) if you use important! you're writing bad CSS
It is true that an over-use or over-reliance on !important can be a warming sign for underlying issues with the CSS architecture, however there is a place for !important in well written CSS. Providing it is used responsibly and for it's intended purposes it is perfectly fine to use.

Firstly by using the !important declaration rules from the author stylesheet are able to be overwritten in the user stylesheet. This is particularly useful for accessibility enhancements such as increasing font size or re-adding the underline property to anchors.

!important can also be used effectively in the author stylesheet itself, the most common use case is for utility (helper) classes. Utility classes are often used to set up base rules for a project, these are rules which should always be applied, yet are usually defined at the top of a stylesheet and have low specificity. 

```
.margin-bottom {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}
```
The specificity of the selector above is just 0,0,1,0 and so the value could be easily overwritten further down the stylesheet. To address this and make helper classes more resilient the !important rule should be applied.

```
.margin-bottom {
  margin-bottom: 10px!important;
}
```
Finally, although not a valid long term use case the !important rule can be very useful for getting quick fixes shipped to production. There isn't always time for a detailed assessment of the CSS architecture or for refactoring large chunks of code to fix a style bug. In these cases it can be helpful to use !important as a make shift fix, providing the real work is addressed afterwards. It is usually helpful to keep these styles in a separate CSS file (shame css) - ADD LINK TO ARTICLE ON THIS!
















### 6) There is no progressive enhancement

Progressive enhancement is a strategy that promotes delivering the core content and functionality to all bowsers and devices as the primary concern. Then progressively adding extra 'nice to have's' for browsers/devices that allow.

In CSS this approach can be adopted by using the @supports rule. This rule provides the ability to check if a CSS feature is supported before implementing.

CODE EXAMPLE - a nice to have anamate in thing

This also works for graceful degradation by providing fallbacks for browsers wHer features are not supported. To do this @supports not is used...

CODE EXAMPLE



### 7) It's just for making things pretty

CSS can do more then simply apply the aesthetics to an applications UI. It can also play a role in enhancing the accessibility of a project.

CSS can amongst other things also be used to...

- Enhance the readability of content (Font-size, color, line-height)
- Replace the default underline on links to avoid cutting through descenders (Example CSS)
- Visually hidden styles aid accessibility
- active and visited classes also
- skip links



### 8) Shorthand is better


It may result in !important declarations being added to all the sub properties!!!!

 
Shorthand properties allow multiple values to be set for a group of CSS properties simultaneously. There are 6 shorthand properties to date font, background, margin, border, padding and list.

The feature is intended to allow for more concise and more readable style sheets, as well as saving time and being more performant.

```
font-style: italic;
font-weight: bold;
font-size: .8em;
line-height: 1.2;
font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
```

```
font: italic bold .8em/1.2 Arial, sans-serif;
```

However a value which is not specified is automatically set to its initial value. Therefore the shorthand syntax is not always the most effective approach.


#### Good use case

```
padding: 10px;
```

```
padding-top: 10px;
padding-right: 10px;
padding-bottom: 10px;
padding-left: 10px;
```

#### Good use case if you want it everywhere

```
margin: 0
```

```
margin-top: 0
margin-right: 0
margin-bottom: 0
margin-left: 0
```

```
.foo {
  margin: 12px 17px 16px 10px;
}
```

#### Bad use case
```
margin: 0 auto;
```

```
margin-right: auto;
margin-left:  auto;
```




 - You mat have to override later



### 9) You cant use functions

CSS is defined as a mark up language not a programing or scripting language, however it does come with some functions included.

 - Calc() etc
 - new css4 stuff
 - CALCULATIONS WITH CUSTOM PROPERTIES

### 10) You need a framework

There are loads of helpful frameworks to speed up CSS projects and get the base principles in place.

- Normalize
- Fondation
- Bootstrap

- Print.CSS - ???
- a11y - ???
- ITCSS - ???
- Smacss - ????
- OOCSS - ????


These are useful and safe, but you should understand them before you use them.

You do not have to use a CSS framework, and there are a lot of them out there. This implies that to create good code without one is difficult or even impossible, it isn't.

### 11) Frameworks are bad

Following on from the point above, frameworks are not essential but that doesn't mean they are all bad. The important thing is that you understand how and why they work before using them.

You should have an understanding of the tools you use so that you can function without the framework when needed, and most importantly so that you understand how and why things are working.




### 13) Inline CSS is bad

For speed and loading it can be good





### In summary

A bad workmen blames his tools, the featured of CSS are not secret, anyone can read up on and learn to write good CSS in a structured and maintainable way. If you choose not to, CSS can become a nightmare.
