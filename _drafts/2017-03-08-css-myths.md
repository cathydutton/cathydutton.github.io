CSS gets a lot of abuse, the internet is full of articles describing ways to fix one, or all of it's so called failings. However most of the time these criticisms are unfair, untrue or both. This post aims to highlight some of the common misconceptions or myths around CSS and it's capabilities.

### 1) CSS is broken

So first of all CSS is not broken, it just isn't a programing language and so should not be expected to behave like one. Many of the CSS in JavaScript methodologies that have appeared aim to 'fix' CSS by forcing it to behave in a more conventional programming way, in doing so some fundamental CSS features are sacrificed.

You can read more on the topic of broken CSS in these two fantastic articles...

### 2) CSS is easy
CSS is not easy, it may been seen as the simplest of the front end languages, but creating a maintainable CSS code base at scale is a difficult skill to master. Like no other front end language any changes made in CSS have the potential to affect the global landscape, meaning extra discipline and knowledge are required.

To work effectively a detailed understanding of key CSS features is essential, these features are frequently misunderstood leading to assumptions that CSS itself is broken.


<!--
#### Cascade

<blockquote>
<p>The CSS cascade assigns a weight to each style rule. When several rules apply, the one with the greatest weight takes precedence.</p>

<p>https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/cascade.html</p>
</blockquote>


CSS declarations cascade down to elements from many origins.

"The cascade is probably one of the most misunderstood features of CSS. It refers to the process of combining different stylesheets and resolving conflicts between CSS selectors.

The cascade looks at the importance, origin, specificity, and order of declarations to determine which style rules to use."

"CSS is an acronym of Cascading Style Sheets, which indicates that the notion of the cascade is important. At its most basic level it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter, but it's more complex than that. What selectors win out in the cascade depends on three factors (these are listed in order of weight — earlier ones will overrule later ones):

Importance
Specificity
Source order"

#### Inheritance
"is the means by which, in the absence of any specific declarations applied by the CSS cascade, a property value of an element is obtained from its parent element.""

"Inheritance is the process where values that apply to an element can be passed on (or inherited) by its children."

"Not all properties are inherited by default. Understanding inheritance is key to writing more deliberate and less verbose CSS. Forcing inheritance with the inherit keyword can be incredibly useful."

#### Specificity
"Specificity is a mechanism within the CSS cascade that aids conflict resolution. The concept of specificity states that when two or more declarations that apply to the same element, and set the same property, have the same importance and origin, the declaration with the most specific selector will take precedence.""

"Specificity is a weighting given to selectors. It’s a common mistake to think of this as a single number. It’s actually 4 separate numbers or 4 categories of weighting.

To calculate specificity, count the number of:

IDs,

classes, attributes and pseudo-classes,

elements and pseudo-elements

For example: #nav .selected:hover > a::before will be 1, 2, 2."


#### The box model

"Understanding the Box Model is essential and necessary for limiting frustration when working with layout and positioning. It is one of the most fundamental concepts in CSS.

The box model is used to calculate the width and height of elements. It is a calculation step and not solely relied upon for determining the final layout and positioning of elements."

box-sizing: border-box often allows elements to behave in amore expected way.-->






###  3) Global scope is a bad thing

CSS is global by default which is a great feature, if you know how to use it. The cascade and inheritance together determine how all elements will be styled, this allows you to create base level rules just once and have them applied across a projects code base. 

Benefits of the CSS global scope:
 
 * New markup looks right without the need to add any new CSS
 * Typography and spacing are consistent
 * Repeated patterns and objects will all be ??????
 * dsf




The global scope is often compared unfavourably to the localised scoping features of JavaScript. 

If you find yourself relying on numerous declarations of important! to override global styles then you have a much bigger problem then rouge CSS selectors.


Example usage of global styles:

```

.button {

}

```



###  4) There is no local scope

It is possible to scope your CSS, in the most basic form by using double classes or a naming convention such as BEM

Example of both

In the more familiar programming language you can add scope to your CSS using custom properties.

Give code example.

https://css-tricks.com/making-custom-properties-css-variables-dynamic/


https://vgpena.github.io/winning-with-css-variables/
 
CSS where required can be scoped. Using naming conventions such as BEM, nested classes of double selector classes CSS can target specific chunks of UI without effecting the entire application.



```
.button {

} 

.button .button-primary {

}

.button .button-secondary {

}

```


### 5) important! is bad

"CSS is an acronym of Cascading Style Sheets, which indicates that the notion of the cascade is important. At its most basic level it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter, but it's more complex than that. What selectors win out in the cascade depends on three factors (these are listed in order of weight — earlier ones will overrule later ones):

Importance
Specificity
Source order"

Overides specificity and source order in the cascade.

Used to overriding author stylesheets


6.4.2 !important rules

CSS attempts to create a balance of power between author and user style sheets. By default, rules in an author's style sheet override those in a user's style sheet (see cascade rule 3).

However, for balance, an "!important" declaration (the delimiter token "!" and keyword "important" follow the declaration) takes precedence over a normal declaration. Both author and user style sheets may contain "!important" declarations, and user "!important" rules override author "!important" rules. This CSS feature improves accessibility of documents by giving users with special requirements (large fonts, color combinations, etc.) control over presentation.

The most common way to use user style sheets is to add the underline back to links. You would do this by simply adding the following CSS property to your user style sheet:

```
:link, :visited { text-decoration: underline ! important; }
```



This leads nicely on to the next myth, important! is not always bad. its existence as a genuine CSS property alone should confirm that. Prviding it is used responsibly and for it's intended purposes it is fine to use.

### 6) There is no progressive enhancement

Progressive enhancement is a strategy that promotes delivering the core content and functionality to all bowsers and devices as the primary concern. Then progressively adding extra 'nice to have's' for browsers/devices that allow.

In CSS this approach can be adopted by using the @supports rule. This rule provides the ability to check if a CSS feature is supported before implementing.

CODE EXAMPLE - a nice to have anamate in thing

This also works for graceful degradation by providing fallbacks for browsers wer features are not supported. To do this @supports not is used...

CODE EXAMPLE



### 7) It's just for making things pretty

CSS can do more then simply apply the aesthetics to an applications UI. It can also play a role in enhancing the accessibility of a project.

CSS can amongst other things also be used to...

- Enhance the readability of content (Font-size, color, line-height)
- Replace the default underline on links to avoid cutting through descenders (Example CSS)
- Visually hidden styles aid accessibility
- active and visited classes also
- skip links



### 8) Shorthand is better
Shorthand properties allow multiple values to be set for a group of CSS properties simultaneously. There are 6 shorthand properties to date font, background, margin, border, padding and list.

The feature is intended to allow for more concise and more readable style sheets, as well as saving time and being more performant.

```
font-style: italic;
font-weight: bold;
font-size: .8em;
line-height: 1.2;
font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
```

```
font: italic bold .8em/1.2 Arial, sans-serif;
```

However a value which is not specified is automatically set to its initial value. Therefore the shorthand syntax is not always the most effective approach.


#### Good use case

```
padding: 10px;
```

```
padding-top: 10px;
padding-right: 10px;
padding-bottom: 10px;
padding-left: 10px;
```

#### Good use case if you want it everywhere

```
margin: 0
```

```
margin-top: 0
margin-right: 0
margin-bottom: 0
margin-left: 0
```

```
.foo {
  margin: 12px 17px 16px 10px;
}
```

#### Bad use case
```
margin: 0 auto;
```

```
margin-right: auto;
margin-left:  auto;
```




 - You mat have to override later



### 9) You cant use functions

CSS is defined as a mark up language not a programing or scripting language, however it does come with some functions included.

 - Calc() etc
 - new css4 stuff
 -

### 10) You need a framework

There are loads of helpful frameworks to speed up CSS projects and get the base promciples in place.

- Normalize
- Print.CSS
- a11y
- ITCSS
- Smacss
- OOCSS
- Fondation
- Bootstrap
- The one that Dave mentioned

These are useful and safe, but you should understand them before you use them.

You do not have to use a CSS framework, and there are a lot of them out there. This implies that to create good code without one is difficult or even imposible, it isn't.

### 11) Frameworks are bad

Following on from the point above, frameworks are not essential but that doesn't mean they are all bad. The important thing is that you understand how and why they work before using them.

You should have an understanding of the tools you use so that you can function without the framework when needed, and most importantly so that you understand how and why things are working.

### 12) If it's new you should be using it
Talk about targeting dom secific stuff in CSS 4
Talk about browser support


### 13) Inline CSS is bad

For speed and loading it can be good





### In summary

A bad workmen blames his tools, the featured of CSS are not secret, anyone can read up on and learn to write good CSS in a structured and maintainable way. If you choose not to CSS can become a nightmare.
