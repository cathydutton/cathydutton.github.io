#Why did we fall in love with Sass???

Variables
Mixins
Functions

##What did this solve?
????
?????

##Can CSS now do this??

Grid CS
Custom properties
Calc for font sizes and vertical rhythem

PostCSS can help with the transition


### Become less reliant on Sass, write CSS and phase out PostCSS as and when CSS gets better

Autoprefixer
Grid layouts etc


Use Gulp to post process - less tying - free to remove from just one fie once complete
