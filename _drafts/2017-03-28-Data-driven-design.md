### Design the data capture

You should no what data you will want to capture from Analytics before you start - design this as part of the design process.

Design the questions from the feedback form.


### Look at the big picture

Don't design tests around small things like button clicks  - You may improve results for that section but have a negative impact on the main goal or user journey.
