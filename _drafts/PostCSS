Each element should not respond to ‘global’ media queries - sometimes content just doesn’t fit.

Every element should be able to have its own medial element query. This will create completely independent code blocks just like the design process.


Then - how do we load the CSS - Ea h page bundles its own component file to go along with the global file.


Then clever load - Critically inline - non render blocking include (Ascnc - <preload> tag etc)
