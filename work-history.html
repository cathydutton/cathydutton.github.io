		<p class="highlight-quote">Over the years I have had the pleasure of working for some awesome companies on a range of projects. below are a few highlights...</p>

		<h4>Defra</h4>
		<p>I am currently employed as a senior interaction &amp; service designer for the DEFRA working as part of the Digital Defra team.</p> 
		<p>I am responsible for:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Using research insights and data to design solutions; responding to challenges, with users, frontline staff and stakeholders</li>
			<li>Creating prototypes for testing; working quickly from sketchwork to coded prototypes that can be iterated and tested rapidly</li>
			<li>Undertaking user research sessions, compiling findings and mapping user journeys</li>
			<li>Working within and agile team turning concepts into user centered services</li>
			<li>Defining and designing the interface and structure for digital services</li>
		</ul>

		<p>I design services that are engaging, accessible and easy to navigate for a range of government services including the 'I want to fish' service and a UK wide waste tracing service.</p>

		<h4>Barclays</h4>
		<p>During my time at Barclays I was a part of an interdisciplinary team of designers including Interaction, User Interface, User Experience and Service, working collaboratively alongside Developers and Product Owners to create and deliver live releases as part of the Barclays API store team.</p>

		<p> I was responsible for creating innovative user experiences as well as developing user journeys and profiles. I was also responsible for producing performant and accessible solutions to tight deadlines.</p>

		<h4>The Hut Group</h4>
	 	<p>The Hut Group is the UK’s leading multi-website retailer, with over 28 websites covering fashion, beauty, health and lifestyle. As part of the UX team I was responsible for delivering best in class eCommerce experiences across a portfolio of sites and services. </p>

		<p>	I worked within a team of User Interface and User Experience Designers as well as Front End Developers and Data Scientists. Projects ranged from full site builds, too creating new features and performance enhancements. </p>

		<h4>ao.com</h4>
		<p>At ao.com I was responsible for building a responsive framework to be used across the company’s main website and on the new TV & Audio pages. Part of my role was also to create best practice guidelines for Sass and to ensure the site’s CSS was scalable, maintainable and as streamlined as possible.</p>

		<h4>Brightstar 20:20</h4>
		<p>At Brightstar 20:20 I produced wire frames and full design concepts for a range of eCommerce projects for brands such as EE, Three mobile and O2. I was also responsible for producing build estimates and standards documents for a range of Front End projects for both internal and external clients. I also worked on large scale Front End Development projects for companies such as Sainsbury’s and EE, working closely with the Magento development team.</p>

		<h4>Creare</h4>
		<p>As a team leader at Creare I was responsible for a team of 2 to 3 junior Designers and Developers. This enabled me to develop my project management, organisational and mentoring skills. I also undertook 2 to 3 web projects per month taking sites from concept generation through to development and on site optimisation.</p>
