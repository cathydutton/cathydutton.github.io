		<p>Over the years I have had the pleasure of working for some awesome companies on a range of projects. below are a few highlights...</p>

		<p><i class="accent">Barclays - </i>I am currently employed by Barclays working with a global team on both internal and external projects. Working a part of an agile team I am responsible for creating innovative user experiences and developing user journeys and profiles. I am also responsible for producing performant and accessible solutions to tight deadlines.</p>

	 	<p><i class="accent">The Hut Group - </i>During my time at the Hut I worked on a range of sites both internally and customer facing. Projects ranged from full site builds, to creating new features and site enhancements.
I was able to expand my JavaScript skills as well gaining more experience in an Agile work environment. </p>

		<p><i class="accent">ao.com - </i>At ao.com I was responsible for building a responsive framework to use across the company’s main website. I also developed responsive templates to aid the future development of key pages including the top level category pages, top 5 pages and brand pages.
Part of my role was also to create Sass best practice guidelines and to ensure the site’s css was scalable, maintainable and as streamlined as possible.</p>

		<p><i class="accent">Creare - </i>As a team leader at Creare I was responsible for managing projects, scheduling, planning, training and financial targets. Whilst managing a team of 2 to 3 designers/developers I also undertook 2 to 3 web projects per month taking sites from concept generation through to development and on site optimisation.
Whilst at Creare I was able to develop my project management skills whilst also improving my knowledge of both Magento and WordPress.</p>
