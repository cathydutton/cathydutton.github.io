<p class="highlight-quote">
 Any business or organisation that produces waste has to follow rules for moving it from place to place for disposal or recycling. The rules vary according to the type of waste, and where it is being moved to.

A cross-government collaborative team recently started a discovery looking at how waste movements are tracked across the UK. The team is keen to hear from regulators and businesses, to find out more about their needs. In this post I’ll explain what the discovery is all about, and how to contact the team if you’re interested in taking part in the research.
