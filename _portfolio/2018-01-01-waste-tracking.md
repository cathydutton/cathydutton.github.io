 Each year the UK produces over 40 million tonnes of waste, all of this waste needs to be transported, treated and disposed of correctly. The UK waste management industry currently has over 70,000 employees and an annual turnover of around Â£9 billion with over 23 million waste movements each year.

<h2 class="heading">My role</h2>
I was part of the core project team based in Warrington, working with subject matter experts and stakeholders from SEPA, NIEA, DEFRA and NRW. As a service designer on the project I was responsible for:

 * Working with a user researcher to facilitate and observe interviews, site visits and workshops
 * Working with the service owner and stakeholders to frame the problem and produce a challenge statement
 * Understanding the existing service and it's touchpoints with other services
 * Working alongside a user researcher and buisness analyist to theme both user and organisational needs
 * Creating a selection of journey maps detailing the service through the eyes of the user
 * Writing a set of Hypothesis to test throughout discovery
 * Producing 'how might We' statements for potential Alpha projects

Cathy Joined DEFRA as an Interaction Designer but is currently demonstrating the skills and capabilities of a Service Designer.  Cathy is able to think strategically and understands the context she is working in. Cathy is showing great resilience and supporting the Service Owner through discovery.  Cathy is very much leading the service design aspect of the waste tracking discovery, and now she has finally received the tools, I think we will see some great output coming from Cathy.

Cathy is very user centred, creative and is a great advocate for agile and digital ways of working.  Cathy is great at taking ideas and running with them.
