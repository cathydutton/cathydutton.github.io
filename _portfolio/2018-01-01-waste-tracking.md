 Each year the UK produces over 40 million tonnes of waste, all of this waste needs to be transported, treated and disposed of correctly. The UK waste management industry currently has over 70,000 employees and an annual turnover of around Â£9 billion with over 23 million waste movements each year.

<h2 class="heading">My role</h2>
I was part of the core project team based in Warrington, working with subject matter experts and stakeholders from SEPA, NIEA, DEFRA and NRW. Working as a service designer on a 12 week discovery project I was responsible for:

 * Working with a user researcher to facilitate and observe interviews, site visits and workshops
 * Working with the service owner and stakeholders to frame the problem and produce a challenge statement
 * Understanding the existing service and it's touchpoints with other services
 * Working alongside a user researcher and buisness analyist to theme both user and organisational needs
 * Creating a selection of journey maps detailing the service through the eyes of the user
 * Writing a set of hypotheses to test throughout discovery
 * Producing 'how might We' statements for potential Alpha projects



<h3 class="heading">Understanding the existing service</h3>

Paper sketches were used to capture conversations with subject matter experts around the current waste lifecycle. Images were used to highlight loopholes in policy, areas of lost data as well as duplicate reporting and paperwork.

 <h3 class="heading">Framing the problem</h3>

 After the initial broad research phase ss a team we began to narrow down the problems to be solved

  "symptoms of a larger problem etc -  wants and challenge statement with service owner and stakeholders?

 " What does the business want to achieve and why"

At the end of the excersise we produced a Chalenge Statement for the remainder of the discovery project:

 <blockquote>
 Capture and make available in one place the most useful data on the movement &amp; transfer of ownership of waste

Cathy is able to think strategically and understands the context she is working in. Cathy is showing great resilience and supporting the Service Owner through discovery.  Cathy is very much leading the service design aspect of the waste tracking discovery, and now she has finally received the tools, I think we will see some great output coming from Cathy.
