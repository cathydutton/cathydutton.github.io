 Any business or organisation that produces waste has to follow rules for moving it from place to place for disposal or recycling. The rules vary according to the type of waste, and where it is being moved to.
</p>

A cross-government collaborative team recently started a discovery looking at how waste movements are tracked across the UK. The team is keen to hear from regulators and businesses, to find out more about their needs. In this post I’ll explain what the discovery is all about, and how to contact the team if you’re interested in taking part in the research.

 <blockquote>
Cathy is an Interaction Designer but is demonstrating the skills and capabilities of a Service Designer.  Cathy is able to think strategically and understands the context she is working in. We have been working in a different way with the Waste Tracking Discovery, a way that has at times been uncomfortable for the organisation and the partner organisations, but Cathy is showing great resilience and supporting the Service Owner through this.  Cathy is very much leading the service design aspect of the waste tracking discovery, and now she has finally received the tools, I think we will see some great output coming from Cathy.

Cathy is very user centred, creative and is a great advocate for agile and digital ways of working.  And is great at taking ideas and running with them (i.e. the HMRC Framing the Problem approach).

Areas to improve on:

I’d like to see Cathy be more vocal, although I am seeing this more as we progress through Discovery.  Cathy has the ability and the knowledge but sometimes lacks the confidence (in my opinion) to blow her own tru
