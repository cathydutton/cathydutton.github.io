the new Mobile by Sainsbury's service was announced on 1 July 2013 in a partnership with Vodafone UK. The service launched on 24 July 2013.

Mobile by Sainsbury's was a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) in the UK, operated by Sainsbury's between July 2013 and January 2016, using the Vodafone UK network.[1]

Sainsbury's original mobile virtual network was launched in 2001 but only lived until 2003. The new service, Mobile by Sainsbury's, launched in July 2013, following similar launches by supermarket rivals Tesco and Asda.[2] In October 2015, Sainsbury's announced that it would close the service on 15 January 2016.
