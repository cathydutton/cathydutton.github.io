Susan Ma's love for developing natural beauty recipes stems from her upbringing and life in Cairns, Tropical North Queensland in Australia, where she was surrounded by the amazing plants and botanical actives that inspire many of Tropic's 
formulations today.

After appearing on BBC’s The Apprentice in 2011, Susan is given the opportunity to present her passion and vision for natural and cruelty free skincare to Lord Alan Sugar. Impressed by the products, he spots a unique business opportunity and invests to become a 50/50 partner.

After a year of planning, Lord Sugar and Susan start their Social Selling Business Platform. Their mission is to empower people all over the country and provide them with the means to start their very own beauty business with Tropic, earning their dream salary on their own terms.

Tropic's amazing family continues to grow with more than 7,000 Ambassadors, over 100 stunning products in their range, £13 million being paid out in commissions, and more than 35 prestigious beauty awards – and counting, Tropic’s amazing family continues to grow. Susan can’t wait to see what the future holds and share the next stages of our story with beauty lovers all over the country.

On March 11th 2017, we staged our biggest Glambassadors event yet! To celebrate the incredible successes of our inspirational Ambassadors, we invited over 1,000 members of our Tropic Family to our exclusive Cirque Du Tropic in Event City, Manchester!
