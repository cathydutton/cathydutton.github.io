<p class="highlight-quote">
Angling generates over £1 billion for the UK economy, and is a much loved outdoor sport connecting people with nature. Each year the Environment Agency sells fishing licences to around a million customers generating £22 million of income that is re-invested back into the fisheries and the environment across England and Wales.

<h2 class="heading">My role</h2>

I was hired in 2016 as an interaction designer on the 'Buy a rod fishing licence' service. After the successful launch of the service into private beta I began to look at the end to end service for Anglers, taking on the responsibility of creating an as is service map to highlight user needs, organisational needs and pain points in the service.

During the project I was responsible for:

 * Creating a service map to show the current end to end service
 * Working with the Fisheries department, Bailiffs, marketing team and users to get a clearer understanding of the service gaols
 <!-- * Creating an assumption map to be used in user research to prove or disprove ideas for improving the service -->
 <!--* Creating a dashboard to show sales across all channels -->

 <!-- Add images of both maps -->


<!-- Google tag manager - Dashboard of all sales

The ‘I want to fish’ service is ….

Highlighting key drivers for angling “Sense of achievement”, “Health and well being”, “social” etc.

Highlighting key user needs “I want to fish”, “I want to enjoy nature”, “I want to relax”

Highlight key organisational needs “We need to keep rivers clean”, “We need to conserve freshwater and migratory fish stocks and report on this too???”, and “We need to increase participation in order to improve the environment”

Working on service mapping and end to end user journeys, working with policy, bailiffs call centre staff, fisheries officers, users and the communications team to highlight key pain points in the current user journey.
