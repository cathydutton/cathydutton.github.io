<p class="highlight-quote">
Angling generates over £1 billion for the UK economy, and is a much loved outdoor sport connecting people with nature. Each year the Environment Agency sells fishing licences to around a million customers generating £22 million of income that is re-invested back into the fisheries and the environment across England and Wales.

<h2 class="heading">My role</h2>

I was hired in 2016 as an interaction designer on the 'Buy a rod fishing licence' service. After the successful launch of the service into private beta I began to look at the end to end service for Anglers, taking on the responsibility of creating an as is service map to highlight user needs, organisational needs and pain points in the service.

During the project I was responsible for:

 * Working with the Fisheries department, Bailiffs, marketing team and anglers to get a clearer understanding of the service goals
 * Creating a service map to show the current end to end service, pain points and outcomes
 * Work towards a service methodology to help create a service vision and mission statement
 * Creating an assumption map to be used in user research to prove or disprove ideas for improving the service
