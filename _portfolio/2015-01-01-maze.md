<p class="highlight-quote">
Maze is a flexible and semantic mobile first responsive grid built with PostCSS. The code is fully customisable and removes the reliance on classes like .last-column by instead applying the margin to both sides of each element and adjusting the wrapper width accordingly.
</p>

<h2 class="heading">The grid</h2>

The grid flrexability of the grid allows it to be esily modified to suit any layout.


Settings

By default Maze works with 5 media queries and has a margin of 1%. These settings can be overridden with custom config. All media query dimensions should be written in EM's, and margins as a percentage...

<h2 class="heading">The code</h2>

Firstly the wrapper is given a property of grid-container with a value of true...

This calculates the wrapper width based on the values assigned to the largest and smallest media queries, and adds a clearfix.

The max width is calculated accounting for the element margins...

Each element is then created as a ratio at a set media query...

The above element will display one per row at mobile, two per row at landscape and 4 per row at tablet. The Mobile declaration is the default value and therefore is not rendered inside a media query.
