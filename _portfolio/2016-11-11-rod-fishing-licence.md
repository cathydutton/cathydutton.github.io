<p class="highlight-quote">The ‘buy a rod fishing licence’ service is an digital transformation service delivered through GOV UK to enable anglers to purchase a fishing rod licence.</p>

<p class="highlight-quote">
Angling creates over 37,000 full time jobs and generates over £1 billion for the UK economy, but at its heart it’s a much loved outdoor sport connecting people with nature. We’ve listened to anglers’ concerns and improved the fishing licence to make the process of getting out and fishing legally simpler.</p>

The service went live in January 2017 and took over £22million from 500,000 transactions in its first 2 months, with an estimated £40million and 1.2million transactions by the end of 2017. 

The service won a corporate services recognition award for “Making it simple” in March 2017 and was nominated for a blah blah award in June 2017



The positive feedback for the service is over 96% making it one of the highest in ????

Probably the easiest website I have ever used to make a purchase. Well done

Excellent service and really appreciate change to validity from date of purchase 

Very easy to navigate, and delighted junior licence is now free!

The whole process was very easy. The boxes and questions were intuitive. -  - Good effort, hard to see how it can be improved.

MUCH MUCH MUCH better than the previous post office website.

Interview

“Interview: GDS leader Kevin Cunnington on Whitehall 'self-help groups', spend controls and cold water swimming
”

“Whenever Kevin Cunnington talks about the digital services the government will have built by 2020, he starts by enthusing about applying for a fishing licence online.
Imagine CSW’s disappointment, then, when we ask the new director general of the Government Digital Service whether this focus on the gentle riverside pursuit is driven by a personal interest – and he responds with a quizzical look and a laugh. “No...” he says, pausing to check it isn’t a trick question. “It’s just a great application. I’m not a fisherman.”
