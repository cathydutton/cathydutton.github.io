<p class="highlight-quote">
Angling generates over £1 billion for the UK economy, and is a much loved outdoor sport connecting people with nature. The ‘buy a rod fishing licence’ service is a digital transformation service to enable anglers to purchase a fishing rod licence.
</p>

<h2 class="heading">My role</h2>

My role was to design, prototype and test a fully GDS compliant user journey and interface, working within an agile, multi-disciplinary team environment. I worked alongside a cross-section of business colleagues and key steakholders to ensure the service met both user and organisational needs.

During the project I was responsable for:

* Prototyping design concepts on paper, in code and with Balsamiq
* Observing user research sesions and defining outcomes
* Iterating designs to meet user needs and address research findings
* Delivering continous improvments to the live service based on user feedback gathered from online sales, call centres and analytics
* Designing and implementing tests to improve the userbility of design features
* Creating and sharing Google analytics reports


<h2 class="heading">The service</h2>

The service passed its public beta assesment and went live in January 2017 taking over £22million from 500,000 transactions in its first 2 months, with an estimated £40million and 1.2million transactions by the end of 2017. 
 
<blockquote>
"The panel were particualrly impressed by the way the team have used what theyv'e learned to iteratte and improve the service. In particualr how they had explored different ways of frming questions and different question sequences"
</blockquote> 

The service won a corporate services recognition award for “Making it simple” in March 2017 and was shortlisted at the <a href="http://www.digileaders100.com/" title="DL100 awards" targe="_blank">DL100</a> awards for digital public service innovation in June 2017.

GDS Director Kevin Cunnington referenced the service in an interview with Civil service world in March 2017:

<blockquote>
Whenever Kevin Cunnington talks about the digital services the government will have built by 2020, he starts by enthusing about applying for a fishing licence online.

Imagine CSW’s disappointment, then, when we ask the new director general of the Government Digital Service whether this focus on the gentle riverside pursuit is driven by a personal interest – and he responds with a quizzical look and a laugh. “No...” he says, pausing to check it isn’t a trick question. “It’s just a great application. I’m not a fisherman.
</blockquote>

<h3 class="heading">Continous improvement</h3>

After the the launch of the public beta site we continued to moniter user feedback to enable us to itterate and imporve the user experience. The feedback was themed too highlight key areas for improvement. 

<h4 class="heading">Licence confirmation screen</h4>
The licence confirmation screen is used to capture the users details in order to send out notifacations including the users licence number, allowing them to go fishing before the physical licence arives.

Intitail feedback on the service suggested some users were unclear on the purpose of this screen:

 * “It wasn't clear I would have to write the number down”
 * “What do you send if I give my contact details?”
 * “If I enter both I would expect to receive an email and a text message.”
 * “I’m writing this down… But I’d like you to email and text this to me too.”
