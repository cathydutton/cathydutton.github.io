<p class="highlight-quote">
Angling generates over £1 billion for the UK economy, and is a much loved outdoor sport connecting people with nature. The ‘buy a rod fishing licence’ service is a digital transformation service to enable anglers to purchase a fishing rod licence.
</p>

<h2 class="heading">My role</h2>

My role was to design, prototype and test a fully GDS compliant user journey and interface, working within an agile, multi-disciplinary team environment. I worked alongside a cross-section of business colleagues and key steakholders to ensure the service met both user and organisational needs.

During the project I was responsable for:

* Prototyping design concepts on paper, in code and with Balsamiq
* Observing user research sesions and defining outcomes
* Iterating designs to meet user needs and address research findings
* Delivering continous improvments to the live service based on user feedback gathered from online sales, call centres and analytics
* Designing and implementing tests to improve the userbility of design features
* Creating and sharing Google analytics reports


<h2 class="heading">The service</h2>
The service went live in January 2017 and took over £22million from 500,000 transactions in its first 2 months, with an estimated £40million and 1.2million transactions by the end of 2017. 

The service won a corporate services recognition award for “Making it simple” in March 2017 and was shortlisted at the <a href="http://www.digileaders100.com/" title="DL100 awards" targe="_blank">DL100</a> awards for digital public service innovation in June 2017.


“Interview: GDS leader Kevin Cunnington on Whitehall 'self-help groups', spend controls and cold water swimming
”

“Whenever Kevin Cunnington talks about the digital services the government will have built by 2020, he starts by enthusing about applying for a fishing licence online.
Imagine CSW’s disappointment, then, when we ask the new director general of the Government Digital Service whether this focus on the gentle riverside pursuit is driven by a personal interest – and he responds with a quizzical look and a laugh. “No...” he says, pausing to check it isn’t a trick question. “It’s just a great application. I’m not a fisherman.”
