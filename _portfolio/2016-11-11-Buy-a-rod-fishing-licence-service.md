Probably the easiest website I have ever used to make a purchase. Well done

Excellent service and really appreciate change to validity from date of purchase 

Very easy to navigate, and delighted junior licence is now free!

The whole process was very easy. The boxes and questions were intuitive. -  - Good effort, hard to see how it can be improved.

MUCH MUCH MUCH better than the previous post office website.

“Interview: GDS leader Kevin Cunnington on Whitehall 'self-help groups', spend controls and cold water swimming
”

“Whenever Kevin Cunnington talks about the digital services the government will have built by 2020, he starts by enthusing about applying for a fishing licence online.
Imagine CSW’s disappointment, then, when we ask the new director general of the Government Digital Service whether this focus on the gentle riverside pursuit is driven by a personal interest – and he responds with a quizzical look and a laugh. “No...” he says, pausing to check it isn’t a trick question. “It’s just a great application. I’m not a fisherman.”
