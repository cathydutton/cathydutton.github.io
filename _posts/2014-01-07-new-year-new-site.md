Over the Christmas and New year break I finally found the time to complete the re-build of my blog. Or at least get it to a point that allows me to replace the old site (I&#8217;ve lost all hope of ever being able to stand back and say it&#8217;s 100% finished).

The site itself has not been re-designed but re-coded to incorporate all of the new technologies and techniques I have learned over the past few months.

The css has been replaced with sass and compressed to a minified .css file using Grunt (my new favorite thing).
