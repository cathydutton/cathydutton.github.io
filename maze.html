		<p>Maze is a flexible and semantic mobile first responsive grid built with PostCSS. Maze is fully customisable with editable options for total grid columns, column span, gutter widths and break points.</p>
		<p>Maze removes the reliance on last column margin overrides by instead applying the margin to both sides of the column and adjusting the wrapper with accordingly. </p>
