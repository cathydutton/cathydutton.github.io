I have experience across all sectors of the website industry including, UX Design and Development, Concept Generation, Search Engine Optimisation, Conversion Rate Optimisation, Web Accessibility, Performance and Project Management.</p>
	<p> I predominantly work with Sass, CSS, HTML, JavaScript and Photoshop and have a passion for responsive development. I have worked on a range of projects over the years from large scale bespoke Ecommerce platforms to small business websites using open source platforms such as Magento and WordPress. I am a huge fan of BEM, as well as Git, Gulp and PostCSS. Over the years I have been fortunate enough to work on numerous exciting web projects for well known companies including Sainsburyâ€™s, Nectar, EE, O2, ao.com, Elizabeth Arden, Tropic Skincare and My Protein. I also have numerous personal/side projects including an open source responsive grid built with Sass.
